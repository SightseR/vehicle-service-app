# Vehicle Service App

## Overview

The **Vehicle Service App** is a web application built with **React** and **Firebase** to manage vehicle service records. Users can register vehicle inspections, view and manage records, print service details as A4-sized PDFs, and download all records as a CSV file. It's ideal for automotive service centers or individual vehicle owners looking to keep track of service history.

## Features

- **Register Vehicle Service**  
  Input vehicle details (e.g., registration number, brand, model, year, kilometers, gearbox, motive power, drive mode), engine/chassis services with statuses (Done, Urgent, Later), and brake percentages.

- **View Records**  
  Display all registered services in a table with options to edit, delete, or print individual records.

- **Edit Records**  
  Modify existing vehicle service records.

- **Delete Records**  
  Remove records with confirmation to prevent accidental deletion.

- **Print Records**  
  Generate an A4 printable PDF report for each service entry.

- **Download All Records**  
  Export all service records as a CSV file.

- **Real-time Data Sync**  
  Uses Firebase Firestore for real-time data updates.

- **Anonymous Authentication**  
  Supports anonymous sign-in or custom token auth via Firebase.

## Firebase Firestore Structure

Firestore Path:
```
artifacts/{appId}/public/data/vehicleServices/{documentId}
```

Document Fields:
```json
{
  "regNumber": "ABC123",
  "kilometers": 120000,
  "brand": "Toyota",
  "model": "Corolla",
  "year": 2015,
  "gearbox": "Manual",
  "motivePower": "Petrol",
  "driveMode": "Front",
  "engineServices": [ { "type": "Oil Change", "done": true, ... } ],
  "chassisServices": [ { "type": "Suspension", "urgent": true, ... } ],
  "brakePercentages": {
    "frontLeft": 75,
    "frontRight": 80,
    "rearLeft": 70,
    "rearRight": 65
  },
  "timestamp": <Firestore server timestamp>,

## Notes

- Tailwind CSS is configured via `index.css`
- Allow browser pop-ups for printing
- CSV includes services as `"Type (Status)"`
- Canvas environments must pass `__firebase_config` and optionally `__initial_auth_token`

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                    | Solution |
|-------------------------|----------|
| Firebase Init Error     | Check `.env` or environment config |
| No Records Displayed    | Ensure Firestore rules allow access and `userId` is correctly set |
| Print Window Blocked    | Allow pop-ups in browser |
| CORS Errors             | Ensure Firebase config and domain setup is correct |
